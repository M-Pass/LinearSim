  # model, sample size and standard deviation of the error term). 
    
  # The user can also insert assumption violations of the linear regression, and see how model
  # fit is affected. Possible violations to include are heteroschedasticity (dependency of the error
  # term on x), a few observation that have a huge error term, non-normality of the error term distribution
  # (the alternative used is an exponential distribution), presence of a predictor of y not included 
  # in the model, and non-linearity of the actual relationship between x and y. 
  # The model is fitted as a linear model -- even if the linearity violaton is included -- and a 
  # scatterplot is shown with both the regression line and a smoothed function that will more
  # closely follow the simulated data. At the top of the plot, the 95% confidence interval for the
  # coefficient of the linear regression is reported.
